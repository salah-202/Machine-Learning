# Prediction of Wild Blueberry Yield
### Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the yield of wild blueberries. By developing a predictive model, we aim to estimate the yield of wild blueberries based on various input features. This can be valuable for farmers and growers in planning their production and making informed decisions.

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
During the EDA phase, we examined the dataset for outliers and removed them to ensure data quality. We also explored the relationships between variables and analyzed the correlations between features and the target variable. This helped us gain insights into the dataset and understand the patterns and trends that could influence wild blueberry yield.

### Build ML Model
To predict the wild blueberry yield, we started by building a linear regression baseline model. This served as a reference point for evaluating the performance of more advanced models. We then proceeded to build a LightGBM Regressor model, which demonstrated improved predictive accuracy. The model achieved a mean absolute error of 346.15, indicating its potential in accurately estimating the wild blueberry yield based on the input features.

This project showcases the process of predicting wild blueberry yield using exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation. The results obtained can provide valuable insights for decision-making in the agricultural industry.
